Today when I try to pull&push form/to github repo, get an strange error:

fatal: unable to access 'http://github.com/finfou/viclearning/': Recv failure: Connection was reset

At first, I thought it's a connection problem, maybe banned by GWF, but at the same time, I can still open github in browser.

Quit for a while, suddenly, I realized the problem could be the force of https usage. So came to .git directory and replaced repo's url form http to https in gitconfig.

Now the pull & push worked again!
